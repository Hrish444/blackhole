				Black holes are formed from mass bursts of energy, and stay alive on said energy for unbelievable amounts of time. 
				They absorb and pull in everything surrounding them to consume, including, gas, planets, and even light. 
				Since they consume so much they are the heaviest things in the universe. The matter they consume is condensed infinitely 
				into the center called a 'singularity'. They are invisible, but can be detected due to the lack of stars, light, and gas, or their
				gravitational affect on other celestial bodies. They push what we know about physics and science and remains one of the biggest universal mysteries.

			<div class="textboxI1">
				<p>
					Black holes can form in many ways. However it always occurs when things merge, 
					like massive stars or multiple smaller black holes. 
					When large entities like stars or suns die, they let out massive spikes of energy, called supernovas. 
					Those spikes of energy have a possibility of forming black holes. 
					But due to how long they live, many black holes are pre-existing and grow over time. 
					Other than those 2 methods, how they form is widely unknown.

					Black holes exist purely to absorb and destroy matter. 
					They are capable of even destroying  galaxies. 
					They are the only way known to actually destroy matter, as it gets pulled in and crushed, 
					with no idea of what it is like on the other side. 
					Black holes form with collapses of star so all they do is pull things in to consume and get bigger.

				Black holes can live longer than anything else in this universe. 
				They only die by slowly losing energy over their lifetime. Which can take 10 to the power of 100 years. 
				They slowly let out small amounts of particles at a time until eventually after googols (10¹⁰⁰ years) of years,
				when it is low on energy. And when it is low, it detonates with a massive  nuclear power much, 
				much more than all we have on earth, then disappears.
