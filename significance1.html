			<p> 
				It may not seem like it, but black holes have a lot of significance in our lives. 
				Indirectly. Our scientists and astronomers observe them from a distance, and what they learn
				changes the way we treat science and physics. The laws of the universe can be extracted from 
				celestial bodies, and black holes are the ultimate celestial body, containing information
				of millions of years of matter.

		<div class="generaltext">
			<p> 
				Observing black holes can help further our understanding on laws of physics like gravity,
				space and time. This is important for ideas like the theory of relativity, which is  
				perfect to compare to black holes, as they proved Einstein's theory correct. Observing black 
				holes also furhtured our understanding of how matter and time interact with gravity, how
				they can bend and warp if there is a strong enough pull.

				Black holes is also relevant when it comes to our technology, specifically, imaging,
				computing and proccessing tech. An example of this is the <em>Messier 87 project</em>, or M87. Scientists 
				and physicists made imaging technology to capture a suppermassive black hole
				with a telescope specifically made to do so. The telescope was called EHT, 
				<em> Event Horizon Telescope</em>. That telescope produced these images.</p>

				<p>The images on the left were taken by the telescope, the middle were made using GRMHD imaging systems
				to accurately judge the look of the black hole, and the images on the right are a recreation of the GRMHD view.
				You might ask what the GRMHD is. GRMHD or General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics is a computing
				system that observes and tracks the electricity, magnetization and the plasma content within strong
				gravitaional fields. It measures them, and displays them so we can see how they work and where these
				energies are the strongest. It is paramount for studying spacial phenomenons. And it would not have been
				possible if  we had never studied black holes.
