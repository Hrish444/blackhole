		 <!-- READ ME!!
		 From here on for the rotations and distortions of the xperiences section, I will use inline code BECAUSE
		  it is the better option. Having everything externally is the mess, because all of these inline codes are 
		  small tweaks that only apply to that ONE thing in the ONE page. Making separate divs for every
		  extra 5 degrees I wanna rotate, or for skewing a text box 10% more actualy seems like the bigger waster
		  of effeciency. My css sheet is a mess anyways, this way I would also be kepping uneccessary things
		  out of it.-->


		<h1> 1. Observe</h1>
		
		<div class="textbox"><p>The black hole is at a safe distance. You see it in the distance far far away. 
		It pulls in all light so everything surrounding it is dark and empty, but the black hole itself shines and burns with all of the energy it has consumed. 
		It is inconceivably large, 50 billion times the size of our sun. Your ship and suit are built to handle its immense radiation. 
		Do you approach it?</p></div>

		<div class="center">
			<button onclick ="document.location='experience2.html'"; class="advancebtn">Approach</button>
		</div>

		<!-- all images for the experience section will be inline coded, as they will require destructive
		 placements and coding. The same will apply to the specialized text-->
